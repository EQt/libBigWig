# Sample toolchain file for building for Windows from an Ubuntu Linux system.
#
# Typical usage:
#    *) install cross compiler: `sudo apt-get install mingw-w64 g++-mingw-w64`
#    *) cd build
#    *) cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/Toolchain-Ubuntu-mingw64.cmake ..
#
# Bear in mind, that the libz in the debian package
# `libz-mingw-w64-dev` usually will be dynamically linked, i.e. you
# would have to ship the `libz1.dll` with the program.  That is why,
# we recommend to build zlib via `ExternalProject` (automatically done
# if no zlib found; see FindLibZ.cmake).
